    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>#ScienceForUkraine is a community group of volunteer students and research scientists from academic institutions in Europe and around the world.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to collect and disseminate information about support opportunities at the university, national, and international level for Ukrainian students and researchers directly affected by the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. These support opportunities are directed towards developing and promoting the scientific careers and research of Ukrainians and offering financial support to researchers and their families during these troubling times. We believe that unity and collaboration can help maintain Ukraineâ€™s long-standing excellence in the European and international research communities.</p>
    <p>We are grateful for support from <a href="https://nep4dissent.eu/" target="_blank">NEP4DISSENT</a>, <a href="http://lulfmi.lv/en/news">ILFA at University of Latvia's Institute</a> and the <a href="https://amu.pan.pl/en/" target="_blank">Polish Young Academy - Polish Academy of Sciences</a>
