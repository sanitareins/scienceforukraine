    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>#ScienceForUkraine is a group of volunteering scholars from academic institutions in Europe and all over the world.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to collect and disseminate information about support opportunities at academic institutions for scholars fleeing Ukraine. Such forms of support prevent the break-up of scholarly careers and enable researchers to sustain themselves and their families while abroad by doing what they know and love to do. We believe that scientific cooperation helps in maintaining Ukraineâ€™s presence in the European Research Area and international scholarly community.</p>
    <p>We are grateful for support from <a href="https://nep4dissent.eu/" target="_blank">NEP4DISSENT</a>, <a href="http://lulfmi.lv/en/news">ILFA at University of Latvia's Institute</a> and the <a href="https://amu.pan.pl/en/" target="_blank">Polish Young Academy - Polish Academy of Sciences</a>
