    <h1>How you can help</h1>
    
    <h2>Institutions</h2>
    
    <p>Given the uncertain situation the support should be
        provided for the longest possible period, but not
        shorter than 3 months. Even such short offers (i.e., in
        form of visits) could provide immediate help and allow
        scholars time and means to apply for more stable
        positions or grants. Accommodation and office/lab space
        should be included.</p>
        
    <p>We recommend that organisations collect information
        on support in a coordinated way. If your institution
        does not have a coordinator, perhaps you can act as one
        to collect the offers and submit them to us in a
        coherent way?</p>
        
    <p>If you submit offers to us, please use <a
            href="science_for_ukraine_table.xlsx">this
            template</a> (Excel). Just duplicate the
        file to your Google Drive or download the file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Forward the file to your <a href="team.html">national coordinator</a> or <a
            href="mailto:sanita.reinsone@lulfmi.lv"
            target="_blank">Sanita Reinsone</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Post the information about the support on your
        website! Provide as many details as possible including
        email and other contact details, so where people in need
        can get in touch.</p>
    <p>
        Contact your country's #ScienceForUkraine <a
            href="team.html">coordinator</a> if you would like
        to submit information about available support or need
        advice about #ScienceForUkraine.
    </p>
