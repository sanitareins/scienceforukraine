        <h2>How you can help</h2>
        <br/>

        <h3>Institutions</h3>
        <p>Given the uncertain situation the support should be provided for the longest possible period, but not shorter than 3 months. Even such short offers (i.e., in form of visits) could provide immediate help and allow scholars time and means to apply for more stable positions or grants. Accommodation and office/lab space should be included.</p>
        <p>We recommend that organisations collect information on support in a coordinated way. If your institution does not have a coordinator, perhaps you can act as one to collect the offers and submit them to us in a coherent way?</p>
        <p>If you submit offers to us, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15vr5VWdUDCYL6Y04QI6trww79b9cNFdg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108901959990868265450&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">this template</a> (a Google Spreadsheet). Just duplicate the file to your Google Drive or download the file.</p>
        <p>Post the information about the support on your website! Provide as many details as possible including email and other contact details, so where people in need can get in touch.</p>
        <p>Contact your country's #ScienceForUkraine <a href="coordinators.html">coordinator</a> if you would like to submit information about available support or need advice about #ScienceForUkraine.</p>

        <h3>Individuals</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>If you are the coordinator of a national/disciplin-specific agency or organization, please get in touch for faster communication.</li>
          <li>Raise awareness among prospective funders and receivers but also in your local institutions and community.</li>
